# AHK - Universal Joystick Remapper (UJR)

UJR is a stand-alone application written in AutoHotkey.   

##### The regular download link for end-users is [now this repository](https://github.com/MURPHYENGINEERING/AHK-Universal-Joystick-Remapper).

UJR is an application for taking axes or buttons from one or more physical joysticks, and merging them onto a virtual joystick (with tweaks such as axis inversion, deadzones, sensitivity etc).

It is used by gamers to fine tune behavior of sticks and perform operations not normally possible such as merge two pedal axes into one "rudder axis."

Download from github and use the uncompiled version, or compile it yourself.
